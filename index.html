// Description:
// This is an exercise in 360 video.  It has an equirectangular mp4 file,
// and uses Google's VR View API (https://developers.google.com/vr/concepts/vrview-web)
// to present it.
//
// Hotspots are clickable and positioned at a fixed point within the 360 view
//
// NOTES:
// What went well:
// Google's VR View API is really easy to use, and pretty straightforward with a great
// getting started page.  You just need to input the right configuration, and you're all set!
// 
// What was challenging:
// Researching which vr library to use took a while.  I researched three.js
// (https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) and WebVR (https://webvr.info/) before concluding
// that VrView would be the least amount of work for me.  That being said, VrView's
// documentation is not the best, so figuring out the methods and parameters to use took
// a little time
//
// Cool aplications:
// -Hotspots can be used to load different pictures, so you could 'travel' through an environment
// -Virtual 360 tours of houses or apartments for sale, so you don't have to go there in person
// -Training simulators, like flight training, being able to look around the cockpit without
//  having to make an actual mock cockpit
// -More immersive pictures - post a 360 pic/vid to social media or send it through a messaging app
// -On a phone, you could move the phone to change the view angle, aka vr
// -Touring a museum, hotspots can be used to read descriptions of exhibits
//
// All in all, a fun little project!
//
